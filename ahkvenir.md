# Ahkvenir

![](Ahkvenir%20Reference%20Clothed.png)
This is the intended form of Ahkvenir in the project.

The proposed POV of the project is from within the cupola of Ahkvenir's spaceship, from which Captain Ahkvenir is looking out towards the other spaceship dragons.

Contributed by Ahkvenir:
Camera positioned behind me (wingless) in the space station looking out a large window at the other draks, wall color is basic metallic grey and window frame is bolted into place 'cause the station is pressurized. Very faint and diagonal square lattice with 1cm^2 cells across window pane provides extra structural support if you want to add that too
